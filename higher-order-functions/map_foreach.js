//Example 1: Get a list of ids from the students







//Example 2: For the students array, if the student has a grade of 60 or above, add the attribute passed = true to the object.
//If the grade is less than 60, add attribite passed = false to the object.







//Task 1:  The teacher needs the class roster. Create an array of the students first and last name. 



//Task 2:  The teacher has decided to add a curve to the grades.  Add 10 points to every student's grade.   




//Map and forEach notes
//both iterate through the array
// Both do not mutate the orignal array
//Both are pass a function as an argument to be called on every iteration (a callback)

//Map returns and array
//each iteration return a value.

//forEach does not return anything.
